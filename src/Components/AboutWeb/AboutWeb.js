          Answers.com is a question and answer site for professional and
          enthusiast programmers. It is a privately held website, the flagship
          site of the Stack Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and
          Joel Spolsky. It features questions and answers on a wide range of
          topics in computer programming. <br /> <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer
          questions.Answers.com only accepts questions about programming that
          are tightly focused on a specific problem. Questions of a broader
          nature–or those inviting answers that are inherently a matter of
          opinion– are usually rejected by the site's users, and marked as
          closed.<br /> <br />
        </p>
        <p>
        Answers.com has received general praise for its architecture of
          handling questions and answers as they are regulated by the community
          Its success has often been attributed to self-regulation.
